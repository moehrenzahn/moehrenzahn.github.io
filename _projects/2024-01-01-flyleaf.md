# Flyleaf

## Flip through articles like reading a book.

{% include flyleaf-download.html %}

{% include flyleaf-screenshots.html %}

Flyleaf is a "read-later" app that displays saved articles from the web in a meticulously designed reading view, without popups, ads or other distractions.

The distinguishing feature of Flyleaf is its unparalleled book-style pagination. You can read articles page by page instead of scrolling vertically.
