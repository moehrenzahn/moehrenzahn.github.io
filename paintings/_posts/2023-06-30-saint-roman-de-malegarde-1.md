A vacation photo served as reference for this photo.

Small towns in the south of France are *made* for painting them. This is actually not my first painting of Saint-Roman-de-Malegarde, I [previously painted a different corner of that town](http://127.0.0.1:4000/paintings/2022-04-29-south-france-cypress/).

It was interesting to play around with the contrast between dark and light to mark the focal point at the end of the *rue*. Together will all of the leading lines of perspective, it makes for a pretty strong composition.
