This painting is a "Master Study" of John Singer Sargent's ["Lady Agnew of Lochnaw"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Agnew_of_Lochnaw). The goal was to copy the original as faithfully as possible. I chose to only paint a section of the larger original in order to have more room for details in my smaller size.

It was very challenging for me to achieve a likeness. I truly learned to appreciate Sargents total control over the subtle shifts of value and color in the face. I struggled for quite some time to achieve similar effects.

In the end, I did not manage anything close to an exact copy. But still, I'm content with the end result.
