This painting is literally an imitation of an imitation of a Bob Ross painting. To paint it I followed [this painting tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOtLhesVh6o) by Nic Hankins, an acolyte of Bob Ross.

It was very interesting to paint on a pure black canvas in the lower half of the painting. It made for a quick painting with great contrast. 

During painting, I was somewhat confused about transferring the oil paint techniques into my acrylics, but the end result at least inherits the pleasing layout of the original.
