I always wanted a big ship painting, so I decided to make my own.

The effect of light shining on and glowing through the sails was hard to get right. I greatly enjoyed watching it all come together when painting in all the little ropes at the end. 

The (much bigger) original painting is ["Land Ho! The Clipper Ship North America" by Montague Dawson](https://wikioo.org/paintings.php?refarticle=AQU3ZM&titlepainting=Land%20Ho%20The%20Clipper%20Ship%20North%20America&artistname=Montague%20Dawson).
