This is a quick small painting of a postcard motif I was given by a colleague as a painting challenge.

It depicts a view of the tower of the city hall of the Bavarian town Wolfratshausen [similar to this photo](https://www.fotocommunity.de/photo/wolfratshausen-alte-flosslaende-christian-pankofer/4857216).
