This is another vacation photo turned into a small painting. It depicts the view of the [Lilienstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilienstein) as seen from Königstein in Saxon Switzerland.

I took a long break between starting and finishing this piece, because I was not sure I would be able to turn the reference photo into an interesting painting. In the end, I think I managed a nice balance of moody fall atmosphere and some cheerful color in the foreground trees.
