The "Argonath", or "Pillars of Kings" are a great monument of the old Gondorian kingdom in J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-Earth.

This painting is of [a scene in the "The Fellowship of the Ring" movie adaptation](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/7/79/Argonath.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20210114222756) in which the fellowship guides their small elven boats over the Anduin river under the watchful eyes of the imposing Argonath.
