Again, something thats right up my alley, combining two of my favourite things: UX design, and LEGO. Interface designer George Cave does an [in-depth analysis of 52 different lego instrument panel bricks](https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/2020/LEGO-Interface-UX/):

> At a glance, the variety of these designs can be overwhelming, but itâ€™s clear that some of these interfaces look far more chaotic than others. Most interfaces in our world contain a blend of digital screens and analog inputs like switches and dials. These LEGO panels are no different.

Some of those bricks take me right back to my childhood. I love how Cave combines his detailed analysis with lots of generally-applicable teachable moments.
