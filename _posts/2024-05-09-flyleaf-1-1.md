The 1.1 update of my [read-later app Flyleaf](/project/flyleaf/) is now live on the [iOS and macOS AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/flyleaf-read-later/id6475200381). It includes some nice quality-of-life improvements, so make sure to grab it!

### New Stuff

- Add PDFs to parse the contents and show them in the Flyleaf reading view
- An "unread article count" badge â€“ if you are into that sort of thing
- Drag-and-drop support
- A new "red" theme
- Bug fixes and performance improvements (of course!)
