Over the last few months, I have been heavy at work to adapt Flyleaf to match the complete redesigns of both macOS and iOS in their 26 versions. This was a significant undertaking, especially since I will not stop supporting any older iOS versions.[^1]

"Liquid Glass" – what Apple calls the the new design language – fits Flyleaf quite well. My custom tab bar already looked a lot like all tab bars do now in iOS 26. The new transparent toolbars with gradient blurs are something that I always wanted to do, but the system frameworks did not support it. Now these elements in Flyleaf use the new glassy look, which is not a huge change, but does look nice, in my opinion.

I also made everything a little more round. This is especially noticeable when swiping up from the reading view, where the swiped-up view now matches the contours of your device:

       muted controls loop style="border-radius: 17px"></video>
</p>

Article titles are also fancier now, integrating the article image.

I also refreshed the app icon. I don't really like where Apple is heading in terms of icon design, but I think managed to keep Flyleaf's unique style while integrating better into the overall OS:

## "Design is how it works"

But I did not only work on how Flyleaf looks. I also fixed various bugs and improved some things.

The most impactful change is that article processing now happens on parallel background threads, which in practice means that adding articles is now many times faster and more reliable than before. 

I hope you'll enjoy this new update – let me know what you think! And als always, if you appreciate what I'm doing with Flyleaf, please consider [writing a short review on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/flyleaf-read-later/id6475200381?action=write-review), it really does help!

[^1]: You don't need to be on iOS or macOS 26 to enjoy this update. Everything except for the glass effects also works on previous OSes. I'm not even sure I can recommend updating to the new OSes right away – it will probably be better to wait a few months until Apple ironed out some of their many bugs.
