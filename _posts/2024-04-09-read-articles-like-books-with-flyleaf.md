Thanks to [Philipp Temmel at *creativerly*](https://creativerly.com/read-articles-like-a-book-with-flyleaf/) for writing up this thorough deep-dive on [my new app Flyleaf](/project/flyleaf/). It's a very generous summary of the feature set of the initial version of Flyleaf:

> Flyleaf is a fully native read-it-later app for iPhone, iPad, and macOS, that gives you the possibility to sync your articles across all your devices through iCloud, features a lovely design and great typography with loads of customization options, does not need an account, and there are no ads or tracking involved.

> No matter if you are reading on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, the pagination interaction in combination with a lovely interface makes Flyleaf an incredible beautiful read-it-later app.
