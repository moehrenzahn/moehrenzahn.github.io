Hot off the presses, today I pushed the button to release Flyleaf 2.1.

This release gave me a lot of headaches, mostly caused by haphazard changes and bugs introduced by Apple with iOS 18 and macOS 15. With 2.1, I think I am at a point where Flyleaf is as stable on the new Apple OS's as on the previous ones.

Since I apparently have no self-control, I also added some new features. On iPad, I removed the ability to show a sidebar, in favor of having your library in full-screen. I'm convinced that that is the better way to use Flyleaf (and it also happens to circumvent a crash in iPadOS 15). On the Mac, Flyleaf also uses this new full-screen view when the sidebar is hidden.

Flyleaf 2.1 introduces a new responsive layout where your articles are displayed in a grid on wider displays. This is a nice improvement, but I had to sacrifice the swipe actions in the article lists to make it work. There still is the long-press context-menu to quickly access article actions from the list view.
