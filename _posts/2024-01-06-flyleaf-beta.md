I built a new app. I's called Flyleaf, and it's a "read later" app for iPhone, iPad and macOS. You can learn more on the [Flyleaf website](https://moehrenzahn.de/project/flyleaf).

The app is currently in open beta and I would love for you to check it out and give me feedback. The reception to the beta has been more than great, lots of people [over on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@maxmelzer/111693068487751097) have said some very nice things about the app.

I'm excited to continue development and get the app into the App Store later this year.
