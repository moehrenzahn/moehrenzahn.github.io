I was graciously invited to write about [my read-it-later app Flyleaf](/projects/flyleaf) on [Apptisan, a chinese newsletter about indie software:](https://apptisan.substack.com/p/apptisan-015-flyleaf)

> I originally studied theology at university in Germany. But I shifted to software development when I figured out that this is a more reliable way to feed a family. By day, I currently work as a Java developer for a small product company in Germany. My first small iOS side project was Devotionalium, an app for reading holy scriptures of different world religions. Flyleaf is my first iOS app that will hopefully have broader appeal (and success)
