> Footnotes on the web are a pain in the ass. You click on a tiny number, get transported somewhere near the bottom of the page, find the footnote you were looking for, and click on a link to go back to where you were on the page.
> This script looks to make that whole process painless.

[bigfoot.js](http://www.bigfootjs.com/) is an ingenious litte JavaScript by [Chris Sauvé](http://cmsauve.com). All it does is convert footnotes into clickable buttons that display the note in a dynamic speech bubble.[^1] this alleviates the annoying scrolling usually involved in reading footnotes.

[^1]: Like this.

Installation was simple: At [bigfootjs.com](http://www.bigfootjs.com/)[^2] you can find verbose installation instructions and documentation of the various settings.

I like to write lots of footnotes, so this is just the right plugin for me.

[^2]: A wonderfully playful page that is worth a visit – even if you don’t need the plugin.
