Like many app developers, I have been living the last couple of weeks in the iOS and iPadOS 26 betas, to get a feel for the new "Liquid Glass" design.

But in terms of Flyleaf development, I have been living in current-OS land and working on an update which I just released today.

The headline of this update is "wish fulfillment", because I have taken care of some items frequently-requested by Pocket refugees:

Firstly, you can now **assign tags directly in the share extension** of Flyleaf. If you have some complicated tagging system, this might come in handy.

Secondly, it is now just as **quick to delete articles** as archiving them. I've gotten rid of the "Are you sure?" confirmation dialog. Instead, there now is a "Recently deleted" section in the app settings where you can restore accidentally deleted articles. I think this solution strikes a better balance between convenience and safety.

I know that there are two other big wishes which are **Highlights** and **Notes**. I've been working on those features as well, but I'll release them in a future update when they are fully baked.

Apart from those new features, I also tweaked the design of some parts of the app a little to better match the new direction that Apple is going towards with iOS and macOS 26. But these are just some minor changes to prepare for my next update which will bring a proper "Liquid Glass" facelift (make sure to [follow Flyleaf on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@flyleafapp) for updates on how that is going).

If you appreciate what I'm doing with Flyleaf, please consider [leaving a written review in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/flyleaf-read-later/id6475200381?action=write-review), it really helps a lot!
