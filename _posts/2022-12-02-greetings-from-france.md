Every now and then, I get contacted by someone who wants to use my old [Star Wars Posters](https://moehrenzahn.de/en/poster/) for some kind of cool project.

I like that, to have created something that people find cool and useful. Last time, [a guy from Siberia literally papered their wall with one of my posters](http://127.0.0.1:4000/greetings-from-siberia/).

This time, it was someone from St Claude, France. The [Prolé Escrime St Claude](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100075111755728) is a fencing club that does real-life lightsaber tournaments, which sounds incredibly cool. They asked to use my art for decoration for an upcoming competitition.

It did not appear to be a for-profit affair, so I gladly let them do their thing, under the condition that I get some pictures. And they came through:

![The inside wall of a gymnasium, again decorated by lots of Star-Wars–themed posters in a wavy pattern.](/images/poster-france-2.jpg)

They must have printed and pasted at least 30 posters all around the hall. You can see photos of the actual event (and lots of lightsabering) on [the clubs Facebook page](https://m.facebook.com/people/Prolé-Escrime-St-Claude/100075111755728/). It looks like a lot of fun.
