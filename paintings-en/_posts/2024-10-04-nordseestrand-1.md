I managed to paint another painting [in between Flyleaf releases](/flyleaf-2-1/)! This one is based on a photo from a recent vacation to the dutch north see. Callantsoog, to be exact.

The drawing is a little wonky, but the values and colors are quite successful, I think. And I'm very happy that I managed to finish this painting in a single three-hour session. It's nice not to mess around with the same painting for multiple days.
