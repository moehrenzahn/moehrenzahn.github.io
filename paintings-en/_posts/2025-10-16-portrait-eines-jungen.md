I'm happy to say that even after a relatively long painting hiatus, I managed to complete this small portrait sketch in just one-and-a-half sessions. There are a lot of issues I can see with the results, but I managed to achieve a likeness I'm happy with.

The source photograph had a bit of a fisheye effect which results in a slightly funky perspective. But I'm enjoying it as a little unusual thing in the realm of paintings.
