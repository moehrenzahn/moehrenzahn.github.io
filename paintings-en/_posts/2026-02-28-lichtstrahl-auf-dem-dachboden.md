This small scene sat unfinished for nine months before I finally completed it.

I went up to the attic in our new house, and the afternoon sun was shining so intensely on a bucket of cleaning supplies and a few brooms it made this utterly mundane scene felt extremely epic. I took a photo, but it couldn’t capture the effect at all.

It was an interesting challenge to convey that effect instead in a painted sketch, and I think I succeeded.
