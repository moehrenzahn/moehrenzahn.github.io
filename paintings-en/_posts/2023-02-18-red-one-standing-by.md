This painting is obviously inspired by Star Wars. I used [this lovely render](https://www.deviantart.com/grahamtg/art/X-Wings-553025406) by 
[GrahamTG](https://www.deviantart.com/grahamtg) as a reference.

Perhaps unexpectedly, the most difficult part of this painting was not the two X-Wings, but the clouds in the background. I had to find a balance between believability and abstraction.

You can see me going back and forth a few times with the clouds in this animation of my painting process:
