I painted this picture mostly to get out of a multi-month rut where I did not paint anything.

It's a little scene of the old town in Stralsund in northern Germany – another holiday photo turned into a painting.

What inspired me about the scene were the interesting color contrasts between the different parts of the image. Also, there are a whole bunch of interesting lines that lead the viewer into the center of the painting.
