This is a painting of [China Cove, a famous beach in California](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Lobos_State_Natural_Reserve). I admittedly only discovered that fact after I finished painting it.

I believe it is a study after Romona Youngquist. I used [this Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUNlxhMp-cv/) as a reference, which I think I captured quite faithfully at my smaller size.
