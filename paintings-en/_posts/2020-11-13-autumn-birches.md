This is one of my first completed paintings. It's a paint-along of some Bob-Ross-style YouTube tutorial. 

It was thrilling to see the birch tree trunks come to life by combining whites and light blues.

The layout is pretty wonky, but I like the way the colors turned out, especially the red foreground flowers, which were my own spontaneous invention.
