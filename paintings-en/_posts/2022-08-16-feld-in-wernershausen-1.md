I painted this pair of cute miniature scenes on a wooden Jenga brick as part of a wedding gift.

I was inspired by the beautiful post-harvest scenery of the Werratal in the Bavarian Eichsfeld. 

It was an interesting excercise to paint on a surface that small. It forces you to focus on the most important elements of your composition. Also, you can finish such a tiny painting quite quickly, which is a plus.

I enjoyed painting in such an unusually wide aspect ratio. It gives the subject a feeling of grandeur and openness - despite the diminutive size.
