I first painted a study of [this painting by Jim Musil](https://jimmusil.com/originals/driftless-area) pretty much exactly two years ago. Back then I had only been painting for a couple of months and I was amazed that I could at all produce output that had at least a passing resemblance to my reference.

I thought it would be interesting to revisit one of my earliest paintings — one I am not as proud of in hindsight – and see if I had improved over the last two years. There are several glaring issues with [my first attempt at this study]({% post_url paintings/2021-01-02-driftless-area %}), most of all the entire sky which I completely mangled back then.

This time, I tried to focus much less on shapes and individual objects, and more on the colors and values of the scene.
