This painting is based on a holiday photo of a house in Austria we stayed in for a couple of weeks. This was my first time painting on a larger canvas and it was very challenging to get a good balance of detail all over the canvas.

It was fun to paint the peak of the Patscherkofel in the background, with some exaggerated proportions of the very recognizable radio towers.
