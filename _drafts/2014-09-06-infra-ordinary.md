infra-ordinary

<!--more-->

„In his essay on the “infra-ordinary”, Georges Perec presents a series of questions. He asks us to make an inventory of the items in our pockets, to describe our street and compare it with another street, to question our teaspoons. “It matters little to me that these questions should be fragmentary,” he writes. “It matters a lot to me that they should seem trivial and futile: that’s exactly what makes them just as essential [as], if not more so [than], all the other questions by which we’ve tried in vain to lay hold of our truth.”" http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/30/stationery-fiends-hand-dryer-enthusiasts-who-calling-boring
