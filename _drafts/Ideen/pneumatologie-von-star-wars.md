Die Pneumatologie von Star Wars

Andreas Schüle:
> The Spirit of God does not need any form of self-awareness or self-affirmation in order to be true to its nature, which, according to Welker, is a form of presence and power for which Western socie- ties have lost both regard and sensitivity. Thus, it is no surprise that the vision of Joel 2:28–29, the pouring out of the spirit on all flesh, and its reception in Acts 2:1–4 are key texts in Welker’s pneumatology.
> In contrast to Welker’s interest in the politics of the Spirit, Wolfhart Pannenberg chooses natural science as his frame of reference for a contemporary understanding of the Spirit. For illustrative pur- poses, Pannenberg uses the notion of a force field as defined by modern physics.5 The Spirit is not so much a presence or power that interferes with and effectively changes human agency in history. Rather, the Spirit is the ultimate formative principle that permeates and shapes every created entity and moves them towards their eschatological fulfillment. The dominant biblical image in Pannenberg is not of the Spirit as being poured out or coming from above but of the Spirit as breath and wind.“
